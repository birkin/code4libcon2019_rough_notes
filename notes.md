highlight notes
===============

Skipping _lots_ of stuff below -- these are some of the things I'd like to look into first

- accessibility pre-conf
    - explore google chrome '[lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)'
    - explore '[axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/)' browser plug-in & automated testing
    - explore '[pa11y](http://pa11y.org)' for automated testing
    - [wave](https://wave.webaim.org), the tool I tend to use, also recommended
    - a google outliner extension was recommended to for getting a quick sense of how a page is structured.

- "Blockchain for Libraries" is Snake Oil -- Eric Hellman
    - great talk about how many of the benefits of block-chain can be accomplished in arguably better other ways.
    - one fascinating note, alternate way of maintaining 'trustworthyness' of a key: [Surety's NYT classifieds](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5nzx4/what-was-the-first-blockchain)

- "Building REST API-backed Single Page Applications (SPAs) with Vue.js" -- Tim Walsh
    - i know there are concerns with single-page-apps, but this was intriguing -- i may watch the video of this again sometime

- "Natural Language Processing for Discovery of Born-Digital Records" -- Emily Higgs
    - talk about using [spaCy](https://spacy.io), a python open-source software library for Natural Language Processing, to suggest additional metadata

- "Of Ethics, Users, and Data: Building a National Conversation for Web Privacy and Web Analytics" -- Scott W. H. Young & Jason A. Clark, MSU
    - cool: non-code tools to go through a structured _process_ (eg conversations, brainstorming, challenge-lists) around privacy

- "programmatic approaches to bias" -- Noah Geraci
    - noted that biases naturally result from the fact that records & iniital metadata will often be from a wealthy non-marginalized person. a couple interesting examples to counteract this:
        - added [wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) labels for indiginous groups because they're often closer to what the group calls itself
        - used spaCy & python gender-guesser to try to give names to 'Mrs. Husband' entries.

- keynote -- Sarah Roberts
    - fascinating info re world i'd known nothing about -- Commercial-Content moderation -- eg, "Report this video as inappropriate"
    - her interest: to render visible the invisible; to better understand these workers' lives and structural influences
    - _hard_ job, engaging with uglyness for hours upon hours
